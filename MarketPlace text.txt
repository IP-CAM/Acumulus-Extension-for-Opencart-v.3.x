The Acumulus extension connects your OpenCart store to the Dutch SIEL Acumulus online financial administration application. It can add your invoices automatically or via a batch send form to your administration, saving you a lot of manual, error prone work.

The Acumulus extension:

* Reacts to order status changes via events.
* Does have 3 admin screens: a settings, advanced settings, and a batch send screen.
* Does not in any way interfere with the front-end UI.

The Acumulus extension assumes that you have an account with [SIEL Acumulus](https://www.siel.nl/acumulus/), also see [Overview of webshop connections](https://www.siel.nl/acumulus/koppelingen/webwinkels/OpenCart/).

If not, this extension is useless and will not do anything.

1. Install the extension directly from the OpenCart MarketPlace.
2. Activate the extension through the 'Extensions - Modules' screen in OpenCart.
3. Go to the 'Configure' page to configure the extension.
4. Go to the 'Sales - Acumulus - Advanced settings' page to further configure the extension.
5. If you have set so, invoices for new orders are now automatically sent to your administration at Acumulus.
6. You can use the 'Sales - Acumulus - Send batch' page to send a batch of (older) orders to Acumulus.
7. To cater for specific use cases, the extension does define some events, so you can intercept and influence the actions it performs. See the separate example module on the Acumulus forum at https://forum.acumulus.nl/index.php/board,18.0.html.
